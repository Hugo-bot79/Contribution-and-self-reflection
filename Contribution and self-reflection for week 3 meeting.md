Hugo Chen: 
Contribution:
1. Prepare the meeting note.
2. Defined the parameter on the table and sent the link of the article to other group members, so that we can find out the mistake that we made and make a proper choice and determine what we will talk about in the project.
3. Discuss on the duties for this group meeting, I will choose the parameter that we need, Abhinaya and XingKun will change the data to floating numbers.
4. Provide at least three lines of new codes, fix the mistakes that I made.
5. Offer help to other group members

Self reflection: 
1. I still don't know a few parameters from these two files, next time I need to read the article thoroughly before the group meeting.
2. Need to read the brief thoroughly to avoid any confusion.
3. Still need to improve my coding skills. And I will need to comprehend the usage of GitHub.
