Hugo Chen: 
Contribution:
1. Prepare the meeting note.
2. Gather ideas from the group members.
3. Contribute three lines of codes on how to plot the age and metallicity relation to define possible accreted cluster.
4. Offer help to other group members

Self-reflection:
1. I still don't know a few parameters from these two files. The link for the article was sent on Friday.
2. Still need to improve my coding skills.
3. Ensure the accuracy of my codes and try to learn how to do the whole projects. Maybe some parameters should be selected from HarrisPartI and HarrisPartIII to do the group project.
